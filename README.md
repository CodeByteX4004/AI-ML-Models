# AI & Machine Learning Internship Projects

## 📌 Overview

This repository contains a collection of end-to-end Machine Learning
projects developed during my internship. The projects focus on solving
real-world classification and recommendation problems using
industry-standard Machine Learning workflows.

Each project follows the complete ML lifecycle including data
preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and
performance optimization.

These implementations demonstrate practical exposure to applied
Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning concepts.
